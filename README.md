# Making sure your containers aren't on Fire: Monitoring microservices with Prometheus

[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/brice/metrics-demo/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/brice/metrics-demo)

This small demo app was for my CloudNative 2017 talk.

## Abstract

Monitoring containerised apps creates a whole new set of challenges that traditional monitoring systems struggle with. In this talk, Brice Fernandes from Weaveworks will introduce and demo the open source Prometheus monitoring toolkit and its integration with Kubernetes. After this talk, you'll be able to use Prometheus to monitor your microservices on a Kubernetes cluster. We'll cover: 
- An introduction to Kubernetes to manage containers; 
- The monitoring maturity model; 
- An overview of whitebox and blackbox monitoring; 
- Monitoring with Prometheus; 
- Using PromQL (the Prometheus Query Language) to monitor your app in a dynamic system
